# 🎮 Hi, I'm Idan Barzellai! 👋

## 🚀 About Me
🎓 I'm currently pursuing a Master's Degree in **Digital Game Design and Development** at Shekar College Institute.  
🖥️ I hold a **Computer Science** degree from Ben-Gurion University, specializing in **Computer Games**.

💼 As a **Game Development Team Lead** at **Spinomenal**, I lead a talented team and collaborate with PMs, designers, QA, and more to create diverse and exciting games.

🎯 Participating in numerous **game jams** and **hackathons** has sharpened my skills in **rapid prototyping**, **creative problem-solving**, and **teamwork**.

🎮 I have independently developed several games, now available on **Google Play Store** and **itch.io**.

🚀 A proud milestone: building a fast-paced, **multiplayer, cross-platform action game** as my CS final project — where I handled **network infrastructure** and more.

🌟 I aspire to contribute meaningfully to the global gaming community by creating **innovative**, **accessible**, and **inclusive** games that players from all backgrounds can enjoy.
